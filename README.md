# Welcome
This is a quick assembler I am writing for an instruction set I'm creating called Tho.

This assembly set will be run on my 8 bit computer, and the end goal for this project is to write something to assemble `.tho` files and 
write them to EEPROMS that can be swapped out on the breadboard.

Also included: a `.nanorc` file for the Tho instruction set.

Second bonus: Tho code to multiply two numbers.
